Given a correlation matrix derived from player box scores, of players vs. players, I utilize the Hierarchical Risk Parity Portfolio Optimization method to create uncorrelated
Draftking Lineups to maximize fantasy points, with the reasoning that the players won't get in each others' ways. This is done for the Tiers, Showdown, and Classic contest formats,
and uses combinatinatorial math to generate feasible lineups given salary constraints. Injuries are accounted for, taken from RotoWire.
